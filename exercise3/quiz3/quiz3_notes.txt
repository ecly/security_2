- Can always make a rewrite system from an equational theory.

Eq. theory:
    plus(A,0) = A
    mult(A,0) = 0

Rewrite system counterpart:
    plus(A,0) => A
    mult(A,0) => 0


A rewrite system should be convergent.
Should converge to some solution that can't be further rewritten.

If you have a rewrite rule l => r, then r is a subterm of l or a constant.
