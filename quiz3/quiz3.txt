    This is NOT a subterm convergent equational theory.
    3 of the reductions are, however the following is not:

    exp(exp(x,y),z) = exp(exp(x,z),y)

    This is due to the fact that the right hand side is not a subterm of the left hand side.


2.
    Choose terms for pub/priv-key pair (e,d) and encrypted message y,
    such that an attacker cannot obtain x from y if he doesn't know d, but anyone knowing d can.

    (N,p,q) = 11, 17, 187
    phi(N) = 160
    Choose e = 19, which is coprime to phi(N)
    d = 19^-1 mod 160 = 59

    GenRSA thus outputs (187,19, 59)

    Taking some number x, the adversary will have to compute the 19th root of x module 187
    without knowing d or the factorization of N.

    We can differentiate between the following parts of the tuple.
    phi_1 restricted (n,k):  exp(pair(n,s),k)/y
    phi_2 restricted (n,k):  exp(n,k)/y

    Not sure how exp works on pairs, but it is certainly by setting 's' to something
    funny that we're able to distinguish between the two frames.
