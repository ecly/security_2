'Bitcoin backbone'
- Prove `common prefix` and `chain quality`
    + Static setting
    + Fixed number of players
- Propose/analyze applications that can be built on top of backbone
- Focus on `Byzantine Agreement` (BA)
    + Not solved by Nakamoto
    + Propose alternative working assuming adversary hashing power bounded by 1/3
- Focus on `Public Transaction Ledger`
    + Guarantees liveness and persistence
- Proves Bitcoin secure assuming high network synchronicity and hashing power bounded by 1/2

# Introduction
## Bitcoin
- POW "Cryptographic Puzzle" SHA-256
- Prevent double-spending attacks
    + If payee waits k blocks for transaction then chance of attack is negligible (in k)

Definition 2:
- Agreement. There is a round after which all honest parties return the same output if queried
by the environment.
- Validity. The output returned by an honest party P equals the input of some party P � that is
honest at the round P’s output is produced.

## Backbone
Protocol parameterized by three external functions:
- content validation predicate V(*)
- input contribution function I(*)
- chain reading function R(*)

Analyze backbone protocol in
- static setting
- synchronous communication network
- fixed number of $n$ players (n not necessarily known to participant)
- players CANNOT authenticate each other (cant source message, meaning adversary can spoof)


## Common prefix property
- t=misbehaving parties, n=total parties
- if t/(n-t) is bounded below 1, then blockchain maintained by honest players possess large common prefix
- f=probability of succesful POW calculation by honest party during round of protocol execution

## Chain quality property
- ratio of blocks in chain of honest player that are contributed by malicious player is bounded by:
    t/(n-t)


## Chain growth (extra property)
- number of blocks added to chain during any given number of rounds

- Common prefix and chain quality of Backbone ensure `Agreement` and `Validity` with high probability (BA's basic properties)
- This turns Bitcoin backbone into a probabilistic BA protocol


Bitcoin provides operational transaction ledger un the assumption:
- the adversary controls less than 1/2 of total hashing power
- the network synchronizes much faster relative to the POW solution rate
- digital signatures cannot be forged

If network desynchronizes, then despite honest majority, ledger is not maintained.

Present new BA protocol assuming honest majority:
- POW fo9r both transactions and for the ledger

# Application
## Byzantine agree for (1/3)-bounded adversaries
- Chain quality should ensure that majority of blocks originate from honest players.

# Model and Definitions
- Protocol II driven by 'environment' program Z spawns multiple instances running the protocol
- Programs can be seen as interactive turing machines (ITM)

# The Bitcoin Backbone Protocol
- G(*), H(*) be cryptographic hash functions with output in {0,1}^K
- Block is any triple of the form B = <s,x,ctr>
    + s \in {0,1}^K, x \in {0,1}^*, ctr \in natural numbers


## Desired properties of the backbone protocol
- Page 19, parameter table
- Common Prefix Property
- Chain Quality Property
- Chain Growth Property

# Analysis of the Bitcoin Backbone
- Honest majorty assumption

## Common Prefix Property
k >= 2 \lambda f
## Chain Quality Property
l >= 2 \lambda f

# Simple POW-based Byzantine Agreement Protocols
## Byzantine agreement protocol for (1/3)-bounded adversaries

# Public Transaction Ledgers
- A "book" where transactions are recorded

Protocol II implements a robust public transaction ledger i the q-bounded synchronous setting
- organize the ledger as a hashchain of blocks satisfying:
    + persistence (for some depth k)
    + liveness (also parameterized by k)
